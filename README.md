# Medical-Students-Health-Record

## INTRODUCTION

The aim of this task is to exhibit my knowledge and skill in analysing data using Pivot tables and data visualisation by using visuals to give insights on the dataset analysed. 

*_Disclaimer_*: _All dataset used are dummy dataset and do not represent any company or institution._

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

1.	What are the average values for the BMI, Age, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol for both genders?
2.	What are the average height and weight for both genders? Return the values to two decimal places.
3.	What is the total number of students across the different blood groups?
4.	What is the total number of students who smoke in comparison to those who do not smoke?
5.	What is the total number of students who have diabetes in comparison to those who do not?

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

-	Data Cleaning and Transformation: filling in the blanks and formatting the dataset to ensure the data does not return errors during analysis.
-	Pivot Table: to analyse the dataset.
-	Data Visualisation: using Pivot Charts to show comparisons, patterns and trends from the analysis done in the pivot table.

## DATA SOURCING

This data was obtained from the Medical Records provided in the Data Analytics Cohort 4 Repository. The data contains 1 sheet which has a table containing 200,000 rows and 13 columns.

## DATA TRANSFORMATION & CLEANING

The data provided contained blank spaces which were cleaned by filling the columns that contained numbers with the average value of their total sum, the female gender was used to fill the blanks in the gender column, the blood group ‘O’ was used to fill the blanks in the blood group column while the blanks in the smoking and diabetes columns were returned as unspecified.

## ANALYSIS & VISUALISATION
The average values of the medical status (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol) of all students were the same.
The average weight and height of all students were slightly different based on both genders when the values were returned in two decimal places.
Students with the Blood Group ‘O’ were more compared to those in the other blood groups.
Although about 10% of the students did not respond if they smoke or note, there are more student who do not smoke compared to those who smoke.
Although about 10% of the students did not respond to their diabetes status, there are more student who do not have diabetes compared to those who do.

## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The analysis showed that although majority of the students smoke and have diabetes, their health status (BMI, Temperature, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure and Weight) was within the normal range.

Based on the findings of this analysis, the following are recommended for students: 
- All students be advised to maintain their healthy lifestyle habits so they can remain healthy.
